Ooh...

I gotta feel at home when I move from here to there
I’m gonna take up space even though I am nowhere
Ooh... Dont Wait Dont Wait Dont Wait
Waiting beside the phone 

Waiting to be called
Get away get away get away get away now
Resist the urge to run from home
Ooh... Dont Wait Dont Wait Dont Wait

No bed Not yet But worth the get
What ails What’s worse is What lies ahead
Ooh... Dont Wait Dont Wait Dont Wait

There’s something that pushes me to move and move and move
Ooh... Dont Wait Dont Wait Dont Wait

Waiting to be called
Get away get away get away get away now
Resist the urge to run from home
Ooh... Dont Wait Dont Wait Dont Wait
